列出6种接入技术：将它们分类为住宅接入，公司接入或广域无线接入
R4. List six access technologies. Classify each one as home access, enterprise access, or wide- area wireless access.

1.Dial-up modem over telephone line: home
2.DSL over telephone line: home or small office
3.Cable to HFC: home
4.100 Mbps switched Ethernet: enterprise
5.Wifi (802.11): home and enterprise
6.3G and 4G: wide-area wireless


第10题
描述今天最为流行的无线因特网接入技术，对它们进行比较和对照
R10. Describe the most popular wireless Internet access technologies today. ­Compare and contrast them.

There are two popular wireless Internet access technologies today:
a) Wifi (802.11) In a wireless LAN, wireless users transmit/receive packets to/from a
base station (i.e., wireless access point) within a radius of few tens of meters. The
base station is typically connected to the wired Internet and thus serves to connect
wireless users to the wired network.
b) 3G and 4G wide-area wireless access networks. In these systems, packets are
transmitted over the same wireless infrastructure used for cellular telephony, with the base station thus being managed by a telecommunications provider. This provides
wireless access to users within a radius of tens of kilometers of the base station.


第12题
与分组交换网络相比，电路交换网络有哪些优点？在电路交换网络中，TDM比FDM有哪些优点？
R12. What advantage does a circuit-switched network have over a packet-switched network? What advantages does TDM have over FDM in a circuit-switched network?

A circuit-switched network can guarantee a certain amount of end-to-end bandwidth
for the duration of a call. Most packet-switched networks today (including the
Internet) cannot make any end-to-end guarantees for bandwidth. FDM requires
sophisticated analog hardware to shift signal into appropriate frequency bands.


第14题
为什么等级结构中级别相同的两个ISP通常互相对等？某IXP是如何挣钱的？
R14. Why will two ISPs at the same level of the hierarchy often peer with each other? How does an IXP earn money?

If the two ISPs do not peer with each other, then when they send traffic to each other
they have to send the traffic through a provider ISP (intermediary), to which they
have to pay for carrying the traffic. By peering with each other directly, the two ISPs
can reduce their payments to their provider ISPs. An Internet Exchange Point (IXP)
(typically in a standalone building with its own switches) is a meeting point where
multiple ISPs can connect and/or peer together. An IXP earns its money by charging
each of the the ISPs that connect to the IXP a relatively small fee, which may depend
on the amount of traffic sent to or received from the IXP.

病毒和蠕虫之间有什么不同？
R26. What is the difference between a virus and a worm?

a) Virus
Requires some form of human interaction to spread. Classic example: E-mail
viruses.
b) Worms
No user replication needed. Worm in infected host scans IP addresses and port
numbers, looking for vulnerable processes to infect.

描述如何产生一个僵尸网络，以及僵尸网络是怎样被用于DDos攻击的。
R27. Describe how a botnet can be created and how it can be used for a DDoS attack.

Creation of a botnet requires an attacker to find vulnerability in some application or
system (e.g. exploiting the buffer overflow vulnerability that might exist in an
application). After finding the vulnerability, the attacker needs to scan for hosts that
are vulnerable. The target is basically to compromise a series of systems by
exploiting that particular vulnerability. Any system that is part of the botnet can
automatically scan its environment and propagate by exploiting the vulnerability. An
important property of such botnets is that the originator of the botnet can remotely
control and issue commands to all the nodes in the botnet. Hence, it becomes
possible for the attacker to issue a command to all the nodes, that target a single
node (for example, all nodes in the botnet might be commanded by the attacker to
send a TCP SYN message to the target, which might result in a TCP SYN flood
attack at the target)

为什么HTTP,SMTP及POP3都运行在TCP，而不是UDP上？
R11. Why do HTTP, SMTP, and POP3 run on top of TCP rather than on UDP?

The applications associated with those protocols require that all application data be
received in the correct order and without gaps. TCP provides this service whereas
UDP does not.

假定Alice使用一个基于Web的电子邮件账户（例如Hotmail或Gmail）向Bob发报文，而Bob使用POP3从他的邮件服务器访问自己的邮件。
讨论该报文是如何从Alice主机到Bob主机的。要列出在两台主机间移动该报文时所使用的各种应用层协议。
R16. Suppose Alice, with a Web-based e-mail account (such as Hotmail or Gmail), sends a message to Bob, who accesses his mail from his mail server using POP3. Discuss how the
message gets from Alice’s host to Bob’s host. Be sure to list the series of application-layer protocols that are used to move the message between the two hosts.

The message is first sent from Alice’s host to her mail server over HTTP. Alice’s
mail server then sends the message to Bob’s mail server over SMTP. Bob then
transfers the message from his mail server to his host over POP3.

a.假定你有下列两个字节：01011100和01100101。这两个字节之和的反码是什么？
b.假定你有下列两个字节：11011010和01100101。这两个字节之和的反码是什么？
c.对于(a)中的字节，给出一个例子，使得这2个字节中的每一个都在一个比特反转时，其反码不会改变
P4.a. Suppose you have the following 2 bytes: 01011100 and 01100101. What is the 1s complement of the sum of these 2 bytes?
b. Suppose you have the following 2 bytes: 11011010 and 01100101. What is the 1s complement of the sum of these 2 bytes?
c. For the bytes in part (a), give an example where one bit is flipped in each of the 2 bytes and yet the 1s complement doesn’t change.

a) Adding the two bytes gives 11000001. Taking the one’s complement gives 00111110.
b) Adding the two bytes gives 01000000; the one’s complement gives 10111111.
c) First byte = 01010100; second byte = 01101101.

p8接收方，发送方也加上
画出协议rdt3.0中接收方的FSM
P8. Draw the FSM for the receiver side of protocol rdt3.0.

The sender side of protocol rdt3.0 differs from the sender side of protocol 2.2 in that
timeouts have been added. We have seen that the introduction of timeouts adds the
possibility of duplicate packets into the sender-to-receiver data stream. However, the
receiver in protocol rdt.2.2 can already handle duplicate packets. (Receiver-side
duplicates in rdt 2.2 would arise if the receiver sent an ACK that was lost, and the sender
then retransmitted the old data). Hence the receiver in protocol rdt2.2 will also work as
the receiver in protocol rdt 3.0

假设测量的5个SampleRTT值（参见3.5.3节）是106ms，120ms，140ms，90ms和115ms。在获得
了每个SampleRTT值后计算EstimateRTT，使用α=0.125并且假设在刚获得前5个样本之后EstimatedRTT
值为100ms。在获得每个样本之后，也计算DevRTT，假设β=0.25，并且假设在刚获得前五个样本之后
DevRTT的值为5ms。最后，在获得这些样本之后计算TCP TimeoutInterval。
P31. Suppose that the five measured SampleRTT values (see Section 3.5.3 ) are 106 ms, 120
ms, 140 ms, 90 ms, and 115 ms. Compute the EstimatedRTT after each of these SampleRTT
values is obtained, using a value of α=0.125 and assuming that the value of EstimatedRTT
was 100 ms just before the first of these five samples were obtained. Compute also the DevRTT
after each sample is obtained, assuming a value of β=0.25 and assuming the value of DevRTT was 5 ms just before the first of these five samples was obtained. Last, compute the TCP
TimeoutInterval after each of these samples is obtained.

DevRTT = (1- beta) * DevRTT + beta * | SampleRTT - EstimatedRTT |
EstimatedRTT = (1-alpha) * EstimatedRTT + alpha * SampleRTT
TimeoutInterval = EstimatedRTT + 4 * DevRTT
After obtaining first SampleRTT 106ms:
DevRTT = 0.75*5 + 0.25 * | 106 - 100 | = 5.25ms
EstimatedRTT = 0.875 * 100 + 0.125 * 106 = 100.75 ms
TimeoutInterval = 100.75+4*5.25 = 121.75 ms
After obtaining 120ms:
DevRTT = 0.75*5.25 + 0.25 * | 120 – 100.75 | = 8.75 ms
EstimatedRTT = 0.875 * 100.75 + 0.125 * 120 = 103.16 ms
TimeoutInterval = 103.16+4*8.75 = 138.16 ms
After obtaining 140ms:
DevRTT = 0.75*8.75 + 0.25 * | 140 – 103.16 | = 15.77 ms
EstimatedRTT = 0.875 * 103.16 + 0.125 * 140 = 107.76 ms
TimeoutInterval = 107.76+4*15.77 = 170.84 ms
After obtaining 90ms:
DevRTT = 0.75*15.77 + 0.25 * | 90 – 107.76 | = 16.27 ms
EstimatedRTT = 0.875 * 107.76 + 0.125 * 90 = 105.54 ms
TimeoutInterval = 105.54+4*16.27 =170.62 ms
After obtaining 115ms:
DevRTT = 0.75*16.27 + 0.25 * | 115 – 105.54 | = 14.57 ms
EstimatedRTT = 0.875 * 105.54 + 0.125 * 115 = 106.72 ms
TimeoutInterval = 106.72+4*14.57 =165 ms
