192.168.1.102

2.  Protocol: ICMP(1)
3. 20 bytes in the IP header. 64 bytes in the payload of the IP datagram because total bytes are 84.

fragment offset = 0 , so data is not fragmented.

5. Identification, Time to live and Header checksum

6. stay constant:

   Version(all packets are IPv4),

   header length(ICMP packets)

   source IP(the same source)

   destination IP(the same destination)

   Differentiated Services(ICMP use the same Type of Service class)

   Upper Layer Protocal(ICMP packets)

   must stay constant:

   Version(all packets are IPv4)

   header length(ICMP packets)

   source IP(the same source)

   destination IP(the same destination)

   Differentiated Services(ICMP use the same Type of Service class)

   Upper Layer Protocol (ICMP packets)

   must change:

   Identification(IP packets must have different ids)

   Time to live(traceroute increase)

   Header checksum(header changes)

Identification fields increase with each ICMP ping request.

Identification is 40316

TTL is 255



9.Identification changes always because it's a unique value.The same identification means fragments of one.  TTL doesn't change because the first hop router is always the same.

10.Yes

information1 : More fragments

information2 : offset is 0

total length :  1480

fragments offset is 185. There are more fragments because more fragments is set.

13.The IP header fields that changed between the fragments are: total length,flags, fragment offset, and checksum.

14. 3 packets are created

15. fragment offset, checksum, total length, flags
