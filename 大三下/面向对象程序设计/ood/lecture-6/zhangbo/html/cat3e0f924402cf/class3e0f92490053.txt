The class: Both the if-statement and the if-else-statement  are described by this
     class. The if-statement is regarded as a special case of the if-else-statement.
     The reason to do this is that when we encounter a "if"keyword, we can not 
     judge whether the following statement is a if-statement or a if-else statement.
     Thus, if we used a "if-statement" class and a "if-else-statement" class to describe
     the two types of statements separately, we would encounter difficulty in the
     decision of the types of the object to create when we encounter the "if" keyword.

Data members:
cmp_left, cmp, cmp_right: to store a boolean expression which has the form
     ( cmp_left  cmp  cmp_right )separator: the CompoundStatement::children vector is 
    separated into two parts.   The elements whose indexes are smaller than this field 
    store the statements    appearing after the if keyword but before the else (if any)        
    keyword, while the  remaining elements store those appearing after the else 
    (if any) keyword.    If this field equals to the size of the vector, the object stores an if 
    statement.
