Fields: 
parent: This field is included here to implement the constraint "the if-else statement 
    can not  appear within a do-while statement".  
    For the requirement of the Lab. exercise, it is redundent since the if-else statement
    must be directly embedded by the do-while statement. During constructing the 
    do-while statement, we can implement the constraint simply. 
    
    But for a more complex, this field is useful to traverse up within the tree hierarchy. 
    For example, if the "for-loop" statement is appended to the programming language,
    we may have a program like:
    do {
          for ( ... ) {
                 for ( ... ) {
                         if ( ...) {  ... } else { ... };
                 }
          }
    } while ( A == B ) ;
   That is, the if-else statement is in-directly embedded within the do-while statement. 
   In this case, the parent  field allows us to traverse up the hierarcy tree to search
   whethere there is a do-while statement enclosing the if-else statement.
   
   Thus, inclusion of the parent field in the root class makes our system extensible.
